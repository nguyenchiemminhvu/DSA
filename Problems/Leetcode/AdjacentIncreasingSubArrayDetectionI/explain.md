```
Given an array nums of n integers and an integer k, determine whether there exist two adjacent subarrays of length k such that both subarrays are strictly increasing. Specifically, check if there are two subarrays starting at indices a and b (a < b), where:

Both subarrays nums[a..a + k - 1] and nums[b..b + k - 1] are strictly increasing.
The subarrays must be adjacent, meaning b = a + k.
Return true if it is possible to find two such subarrays, and false otherwise.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,5,7,8,9,2,3,4,3,1], k = 3

Output: true

Explanation:

The subarray starting at index 2 is [7, 8, 9], which is strictly increasing.
The subarray starting at index 5 is [2, 3, 4], which is also strictly increasing.
These two subarrays are adjacent, so the result is true.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,4,4,4,5,6,7], k = 5

Output: false

Constraints:

2 <= nums.length <= 100
1 < 2 * k <= nums.length
-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000
```

## Observations

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The solution uses a DP array where `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest strictly increasing subarray ending at index `i`.

2. **Key Insight**: Instead of checking every possible pair of adjacent subarrays directly (which would be O(n×k)), we can use the precomputed increasing lengths to efficiently determine if valid adjacent subarrays exist.

3. **Two Scenarios for Valid Adjacent Subarrays**:
   - **Overlapping case**: A single increasing subarray of length `2×k` can be split into two adjacent increasing subarrays of length `k` each
   - **Non-overlapping case**: Two separate increasing subarrays of length `k` that are positioned adjacently

4. **Time Complexity**: O(n) - single pass to build DP array + single pass to check conditions
5. **Space Complexity**: O(n) - for the DP array

## Solution

1. **Build DP Array** (Lines 3-6):
   - Initialize `dp[i] = 1` for all positions (each element forms a subarray of length 1)
   - For each position `i` from 1 to n-1:
     - If `nums[i] > nums[i-1]`, extend the increasing sequence: `dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 1`
     - Otherwise, `dp[i]` remains 1 (start a new sequence)

2. **Check for Valid Adjacent Subarrays** (Lines 8-11):
   - Iterate through positions starting from index `k`
   - For each position `i`, check two conditions:
     
     **Condition 1**: `dp[i] >= 2 * k`
     - The increasing subarray ending at `i` has length ≥ 2k
     - We can take subarrays `[i-2k+1...i-k]` and `[i-k+1...i]` as our adjacent increasing subarrays
     
     **Condition 2**: `dp[i] >= k and dp[i-k] >= k`
     - The subarray ending at `i` has length ≥ k (forms our second subarray)
     - The subarray ending at `i-k` has length ≥ k (forms our first subarray)
     - These represent two separate increasing subarrays of length k that are adjacent

**Example Walkthrough**:
For `nums = [2,5,7,8,9,2,3,4,3,1]`, `k = 3`:

1. **DP Array Construction**:
   - `dp = [1,2,3,4,5,1,2,3,1,1]`
   - `dp[4] = 5` means there's an increasing subarray of length 5 ending at index 4
   - `dp[7] = 3` means there's an increasing subarray of length 3 ending at index 7

2. **Checking Conditions** at `i = 7`:
   - `dp[7] = 3 >= k = 3` ✓
   - `dp[7-3] = dp[4] = 5 >= k = 3` ✓
   - Both conditions satisfied → return `True`
   - This corresponds to subarrays `[7,8,9]` (indices 2-4) and `[2,3,4]` (indices 5-7)
