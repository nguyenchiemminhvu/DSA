## Problem

https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-palindromic-subsequences/description/

```
You are given a string s consisting only of letters 'a' and 'b'. In a single step you can remove one palindromic subsequence from s.

Return the minimum number of steps to make the given string empty.

A string is a subsequence of a given string if it is generated by deleting some characters of a given string without changing its order. Note that a subsequence does not necessarily need to be contiguous.

A string is called palindrome if is one that reads the same backward as well as forward.

Example 1:

Input: s = "ababa"
Output: 1
Explanation: s is already a palindrome, so its entirety can be removed in a single step.

Example 2:

Input: s = "abb"
Output: 2
Explanation: "abb" -> "bb" -> "". 
Remove palindromic subsequence "a" then "bb".

Example 3:

Input: s = "baabb"
Output: 2
Explanation: "baabb" -> "b" -> "". 
Remove palindromic subsequence "baab" then "b".

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 1000
s[i] is either 'a' or 'b'.
```

## Observations

1. **Key Insight**: The string consists only of characters 'a' and 'b'
2. **Palindromic Subsequence**: We can remove any subsequence that reads the same forwards and backwards
3. **Critical Understanding**: Since we only have 2 characters ('a' and 'b'), we can always form palindromic subsequences easily:
   - All 'a' characters form a palindromic subsequence: "aaa...a"
   - All 'b' characters form a palindromic subsequence: "bbb...b" 
4. **Maximum Steps**: We will never need more than 2 steps because:
   - Step 1: Remove all 'a' characters (palindromic subsequence)
   - Step 2: Remove all 'b' characters (palindromic subsequence)
5. **Minimum Steps**: If the entire string is already a palindrome, we can remove it in 1 step
6. **Empty String**: If the string is empty, we need 0 steps (though constraints say length ≥ 1)

## Solution

**Case 1: String is already a palindrome (`s == s[::-1]`)**
- If the entire string reads the same forwards and backwards, it's already a palindromic subsequence
- We can remove the entire string in **1 step**
- Examples: "ababa", "aa", "bb", "bab"

**Case 2: String is not a palindrome**
- We can always solve this in exactly **2 steps**:
  - Step 1: Remove all 'a' characters (subsequence "aaa...a" is palindromic)
  - Step 2: Remove all 'b' characters (subsequence "bbb...b" is palindromic)
- Since we only have 2 distinct characters, this approach always works
- Examples: "abb" → remove "a" → remove "bb", "baabb" → remove "baab" → remove "b"

**Why this works:**
- Any string of identical characters is a palindrome
- Since we only have 'a' and 'b', we can always group them into palindromic subsequences
- The maximum number of distinct characters limits us to at most 2 steps

**Time Complexity:** O(n) - checking if string is palindrome  
**Space Complexity:** O(n) - creating reversed string for comparison
