## Problem

https://leetcode.com/problems/pacific-atlantic-water-flow/

```
There is an m x n rectangular island that borders both the Pacific Ocean and Atlantic Ocean. The Pacific Ocean touches the island's left and top edges, and the Atlantic Ocean touches the island's right and bottom edges.

The island is partitioned into a grid of square cells. You are given an m x n integer matrix heights where heights[r][c] represents the height above sea level of the cell at coordinate (r, c).

The island receives a lot of rain, and the rain water can flow to neighboring cells directly north, south, east, and west if the neighboring cell's height is less than or equal to the current cell's height. Water can flow from any cell adjacent to an ocean into the ocean.

Return a 2D list of grid coordinates result where result[i] = [ri, ci] denotes that rain water can flow from cell (ri, ci) to both the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.

Example 1:

Input: heights = [[1,2,2,3,5],[3,2,3,4,4],[2,4,5,3,1],[6,7,1,4,5],[5,1,1,2,4]]
Output: [[0,4],[1,3],[1,4],[2,2],[3,0],[3,1],[4,0]]
Explanation: The following cells can flow to the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, as shown below:
[0,4]: [0,4] -> Pacific Ocean 
       [0,4] -> Atlantic Ocean
[1,3]: [1,3] -> [0,3] -> Pacific Ocean 
       [1,3] -> [1,4] -> Atlantic Ocean
[1,4]: [1,4] -> [1,3] -> [0,3] -> Pacific Ocean 
       [1,4] -> Atlantic Ocean
[2,2]: [2,2] -> [1,2] -> [0,2] -> Pacific Ocean 
       [2,2] -> [2,3] -> [2,4] -> Atlantic Ocean
[3,0]: [3,0] -> Pacific Ocean 
       [3,0] -> [4,0] -> Atlantic Ocean
[3,1]: [3,1] -> [3,0] -> Pacific Ocean 
       [3,1] -> [4,1] -> Atlantic Ocean
[4,0]: [4,0] -> Pacific Ocean 
       [4,0] -> Atlantic Ocean
Note that there are other possible paths for these cells to flow to the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.

Example 2:

Input: heights = [[1]]
Output: [[0,0]]
Explanation: The water can flow from the only cell to the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.

Constraints:

m == heights.length
n == heights[r].length
1 <= m, n <= 200
0 <= heights[r][c] <= 105
```

## Observations

The Pacific Ocean touches the top and left edges of the grid.

The Atlantic Ocean touches the bottom and right edges of the grid.

Water can flow from a cell to its neighboring cell if the neighbor’s height is equal or greater.

We need to find all cells from which water can flow to both oceans.

## Solution

Start `BFS` from the Pacific and Atlantic edges:

- For Pacific, start from all cells on the top row and left column.
- For Atlantic, start from all cells on the bottom row and right column.

Mark reachable cells:

- Use BFS to traverse from each ocean’s edge, only moving to neighbors with equal or higher height.
- Track which cells are reachable from Pacific (`'P'`) and Atlantic (`'A'`).

Find intersection:

- After both BFS traversals, any cell marked as reachable from both oceans is a solution.
