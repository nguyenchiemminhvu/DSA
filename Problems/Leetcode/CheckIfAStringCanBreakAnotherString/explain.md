## Problem

https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-a-string-can-break-another-string/

```
Given two strings: s1 and s2 with the same size, check if some permutation of string s1 can break some permutation of string s2 or vice-versa. In other words s2 can break s1 or vice-versa.

A string x can break string y (both of size n) if x[i] >= y[i] (in alphabetical order) for all i between 0 and n-1.

Example 1:

Input: s1 = "abc", s2 = "xya"
Output: true
Explanation: "ayx" is a permutation of s2="xya" which can break to string "abc" which is a permutation of s1="abc".

Example 2:

Input: s1 = "abe", s2 = "acd"
Output: false 
Explanation: All permutations for s1="abe" are: "abe", "aeb", "bae", "bea", "eab" and "eba" and all permutation for s2="acd" are: "acd", "adc", "cad", "cda", "dac" and "dca". However, there is not any permutation from s1 which can break some permutation from s2 and vice-versa.

Example 3:

Input: s1 = "leetcodee", s2 = "interview"
Output: true

Constraints:

s1.length == n
s2.length == n
1 <= n <= 10^5
All strings consist of lowercase English letters.
```

## Observations

1. **Key Insight**: To maximize the chance of one string breaking another, we should arrange characters optimally:
   - For string A to break string B: arrange A in descending order and B in ascending order
   - This gives A the "strongest" configuration and B the "weakest" configuration

2. **Greedy Approach**: Since we want A[i] >= B[i] for all positions, sorting both strings in the same order (ascending) and comparing position by position is equivalent to the optimal arrangement:
   - If sorted_A[i] >= sorted_B[i] for all i, then A can break B
   - This works because sorting gives us the lexicographically optimal comparison

3. **Bidirectional Check**: We need to check both directions since either string could potentially break the other

4. **Character Frequency**: The problem essentially reduces to comparing character frequencies in a sorted manner

## Solution

The solution uses a greedy approach with the following steps:

1. **Sort Both Strings**: Convert both strings to sorted character lists
   ```python
   s1 = sorted(list(s1))
   s2 = sorted(list(s2))
   ```

2. **Define Break Check Function**: Create a helper function that checks if one sorted string can break another
   ```python
   def check_break(s1:str, s2:str) -> bool:
       n = len(s1)
       for i in range(n):
           if s1[i] < s2[i]:  # If any character is smaller, can't break
               return False
       return True
   ```

3. **Check Both Directions**: Return true if either string can break the other
   ```python
   return check_break(s1, s2) or check_break(s2, s1)
   ```

**Why This Works**:
- Sorting gives us the optimal permutation for comparison
- If sorted_s1[i] >= sorted_s2[i] for all i, then the "strongest" permutation of s1 can break the "weakest" permutation of s2
- The greedy choice of comparing sorted strings captures all possible permutation combinations

**Time Complexity**: O(n log n) - dominated by sorting
**Space Complexity**: O(n) - for storing sorted character lists
